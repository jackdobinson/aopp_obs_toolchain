# AOPP Obs Toolchain #

*AOPP Obs Toolchain* is a set of tools, examples, and tutorials used to process observational data that can be used as a resource by the professional and amateur community. Currently only *AOPP Deconv Tool* (a Python package designed to apply the Modified CLEAN algorithm to observations in the FITS file format) exists but we hope to include other tools/packages.

The toolchain is hosted on [github](https://github.com/jackdobinson/aopp_obs_toolchain), with the documentation available on this site, and data for the examples are hosted on [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/records/13384454).
